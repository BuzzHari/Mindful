    <string name="accessibility_description">The Mindful app utilizes accessibility service to monitor and intercept websites accessed by the user on selected web browsers. This service functions by fetching the URL of the visited website and subsequently determining if the website has been pre-designated as blocked by the user. If the site is identified as blocked, the service will take appropriate action to prevent access, thereby helping users maintain focus and avoid distractions.</string>
